    <p>Website development, coding, hacking, and anything in between really triggers my curiosity. In a world where innovation doesn't stop, having no knowledge about it is a disadvantage. I developed my curiosity when I was 7, the first time I interacted with computer. I have been wondering as to how it things work behind screen. From there, I have always been hungry to learn about coding.</p>
